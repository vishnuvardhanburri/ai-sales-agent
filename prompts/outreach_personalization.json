Avoid generic corporate jargon and 'hope you are well' fluff. Focus on the intersection of the lead's recent activity and our specific value proposition.",

    "step_1_extract": "Identify one specific 'Trigger Event' (e.g., new funding, a specific quote from a podcast, a recent product launch).",
    "step_2_bridge": "Connect that event to a specific pain point our AI Sales Agent solves (e.g., scaling lead response time).",
    "step_3_ask": "Propose a 'Interest-Based' CTA rather than a 'Time-Based' CTA (e.g., 'Worth a look?' vs 'Can we meet at 2 PM?')."

Most teams at your stage struggle with the 'hiring lag' before new reps are fully ramped. We’ve built an AI agent that handles the initial qualification tier instantly, allowing your future hires to focus purely on closing. Worth a brief look at how we're automating that bridge?"
